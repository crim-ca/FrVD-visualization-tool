# Below mapping is intended for use with:
#   https://www.crim.ca/stash/projects/FAR/repos/video-result-viewer
#
# Application:
#   source/viewer.py
#
# It facilitates mapping of labels from *any* dataset classes to the desired value for analysis.
# The merged results (VD, text, vision) that can be generated with the viewer script will also substitute
# those mapped labels.
#
# Mappings can also be employed to *combine* different classes into one, using same substitution result.
# For example:
#
#   label-1: label-group
#   label-2: label-group
#
# Mapping also support group regexes to facilitate substitution of multiple similar labels as needed.
# Regex substitution will occur after literal string substitution of no match was previously found.
# When using regexes, double escape '\\' must be used to obtain plain '\' after loading configuration.
#


## === AVA classes mapping ===

# --- literal matches ---

# simplify some labels
"bend/bow (at the waist)": "bend/bow"
"dress/put on clothing": "put clothes"
"text on/look at a cellphone": "use cellphone"
# literal replace to also add generic <something> in specific cases
"give/serve (an object) to (a person)": "give/serve <something> to <something>"
"take (an object) from (a person)": "take <something> from <something>"
"talk to (e.g., self, a person, a group)": "talk to <something>"

# --- regexes substitution ---

# following regexes match multiple labels formed similarly
# remove examples and employ generic <something>
"(.+) \\(e\\.g\\..*\\)": "\\1"
"(.+) \\(a person\\)": "\\1 <something>"
"(.+) \\(an object\\)": "\\1 <something>"
