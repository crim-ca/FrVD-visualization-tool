## Description

The tool takes as input the following information and displays them for corresponding timestamps.

- [required] Original video file (production)
- [optional] Extracted video-description annotations metadata (as generated by [FAR-VVD/data-extraction][metadata_extract]) 
- [optional] Video action inference results (as generated by [FAR-VVD/video-action-recognition][video_infer]) 
- [optional] Text subjects and verbs results (as generated by [FAR-VVD/Annotation-VD][text_results])

[text_results]: https://www.crim.ca/stash/projects/FAR/repos/annotation-vd/

It can also combine all of those results into a [merged file](doc/usage.md#metadata-merging) with aligned timestamps.
